# Calendar Planner App

This project is a browser-based calendar planner application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the Day.js library. The app dynamically updates its content to provide users with an intuitive and interactive experience for managing their daily schedule.

## Features
* Display Current Day
When the user opens the planner the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.

## Timeblocks for Business Hours
Timeblocks for standard business hours are presented when the user scrolls down, providing a structured layout for scheduling.

## Colour-coded Timeblocks
Each timeblock is colour-coded to indicate whether it's in the past, present, or future when viewed by the user. This visual distinction helps users easily identify upcoming events.

## Event Scheduling
Users can click on a timeblock to enter an event or schedule an appointment for that specific time.

## Local Storage Integration
Events entered by the user are saved in the browser's local storage when the save button is clicked within a timeblock. This ensures that events persist between page refreshes, allowing users to access their schedule across sessions.

## Usage

Upon opening the app, observe the current day displayed at the top of the calendar.
Scroll down to view the timeblocks for standard business hours.
Click on a timeblock to enter an event or appointment.
After entering the event details, click the save button to store the event in local storage.
The saved events will persist even after refreshing the page, allowing users to manage their schedule seamlessly.
